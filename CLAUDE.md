Root-level files (`CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `build-plugin.sh`) are NOT included in the zip.

## Building the Plugin Zip

After editing files in `plugin/`, rebuild the zip:

```bash
./build-plugin.sh
```

This creates `payit2-campaign-coach.zip` in the repo root. Upload it to Claude via Settings > Plugins > Update.

## Git Workflow

1. Edit files inside `plugin/` (skills, agents, commands, or manifest)
2. Run `./build-plugin.sh` to rebuild the zip
3. Commit both the changed source files and the updated zip
4. Upload the zip to Claude
