    campaign-context/SKILL.md     # Shared context-gathering engine
    campaign-creation/SKILL.md    # Create and launch campaigns
    campaign-promotion/SKILL.md   # Multi-channel promotion strategies
    campaign-analytics/SKILL.md   # Campaign health analysis
    supporter-engagement/SKILL.md # Thank-yous, re-engagement, outreach

    campaign.md                   # /campaign - create and launch
    check-in.md                   # /check-in - weekly health check
    promote.md                    # /promote - promotion strategy
    engage.md                     # /engage - supporter communications
  agents/                       # 3 autonomous agents
    campaign-assistant.md             # Deep campaign health analysis and strategy
    content-generator.md          # Batch content generation
    supporter-outreach.md         # Personalized supporter comms
```

Root-level files (`CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `build-plugin.sh`) are NOT included in the zip.

## Building the Plugin Zip

After editing files in `plugin/`, rebuild the zip:

```bash
./build-plugin.sh
```

This creates `payit2-campaign-assistant.zip` in the repo root. Upload it to Claude via Settings > Plugins > Update.

## Git Workflow

See PLATFORM-STANDARDS.md Section 15 for the full git workflow. Repo-specific additions:

1. Edit files inside `plugin/` (skills, agents, commands, or manifest)
2. Run `./build-plugin.sh` to rebuild the zip
3. Commit both the changed source files and the updated zip
