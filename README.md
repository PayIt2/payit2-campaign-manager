## What It Does

Once installed, the plugin gives Claude four skills you can invoke directly:

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| `/campaign` | Walks you through building any campaign from scratch - fundraiser, event, or group - with story, title, goal, ticketing, cost-splitting, and launch strategy |
| `/promote` | Generates a complete promotion package: platform-specific social posts, email sequences, content calendar, and SEO recommendations |
| `/check-in` | Health check on any active campaign with a score, diagnosis, and specific action items |
| `/engage` | Generates personalized messages for participants - thank-yous, updates, re-engagement, share requests, and unpaid member follow-ups |

You can also just describe your situation in plain language - Claude will figure out which skills to use.

### Works with or without a PayIt2 account

The plugin runs in two modes:

- **Standalone (default).** Anyone with Claude can install and use the plugin. Claude walks you through everything — story, title, goal, pricing, social posts, thank-yous — and hands you finished content to paste into payit2.com.
- **PayIt2-connected.** If you have a PayIt2 account and add your API key (Settings > API), Claude can also pull your live campaign data and create or update campaigns directly. Same workflows, less copy-paste.

You can start in standalone mode and connect later — there's nothing to reinstall.

**Example prompts:**
- *"My neighbor's house burned down. Help me raise $15,000 for her family."*
- *"I'm organizing a charity golf tournament for 120 people. Help me set up ticketing."*
- *"I need to collect $200 from each of 25 teammates for new uniforms."*
- *"My campaign has been live 2 weeks and donations have stalled. What do I do?"*
- *"Write a week's worth of social posts for my campaign - we just hit 50%."*
- *"I have 80 donors I haven't thanked yet. Help me fix that."*

### Components

**Skills** (`skills/`) - Five skills covering all campaign workflows. `campaign-context` is a shared context-gathering engine invoked by every user-facing skill. The four user-facing skills (`campaign`, `check-in`, `promote`, `engage`) can be triggered by slash name or natural language.

**Agents** (`agents/`) - One autonomous subagent (`campaign-assistant`) for deep strategy and campaign health analysis. Content generation happens inline using the plugin's skills, with optional MCP prompts when the PayIt2 MCP server is connected.

### Reference files

Each skill pulls from reference documents that encode research and best practices:

**Campaign creation** (referenced within campaign/SKILL.md):
- `references/story-templates.md` - Category-specific story frameworks
- `references/title-formulas.md` - Proven title formulas with scoring
- `references/ticket-strategy.md` - Ticket type templates, early bird formulas, group discounts
- `references/cost-splitting-guide.md` - Fixed, tiered, and flexible split models with fee transparency

**Promotion (within promote):**
- [post-templates.md](plugin/skills/promote/references/post-templates.md) - Platform-specific social post templates
- [email-sequences.md](plugin/skills/promote/references/email-sequences.md) - Full email drip sequences

**Analytics (within check-in):**
- [benchmark-data.md](plugin/skills/check-in/references/benchmark-data.md) -- Category benchmarks and KPIs
- [optimization-checklist.md](plugin/skills/check-in/references/optimization-checklist.md) -- Full optimization checklist

**Participant engagement (within engage):**
- [thank-you-templates.md](plugin/skills/engage/references/thank-you-templates.md) -- Thank-you messages by tier and campaign type
- [update-templates.md](plugin/skills/engage/references/update-templates.md) -- Campaign update templates
- [reminder-templates.md](plugin/skills/engage/references/reminder-templates.md) -- Group reminder cadences, re-engagement, and celebration templates

### Research behind the plugin

The recommendations encoded in this plugin are drawn from analysis of crowdfunding campaign data:

- Campaigns with co-organizers are 3x more likely to reach their goal
- Each new sharing method increases visibility 2.5x
- Video increases funds raised by up to 4x
- Titles containing "help" succeed 30% more often
- Goals under $5,000 are 2.5x more likely to succeed
- Raising 20-30% in the first week correlates with 80% higher success rate
- Campaign updates increase donation likelihood by 40%
- Optimal campaign description length: ~150 words
