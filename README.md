## What It Does

Once installed, the plugin gives Claude six commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/launch-fundraiser` | Walks you through building a fundraising campaign from scratch — story, title, goal, photos, and launch strategy |
| `/plan-event` | Sets up an event with smart ticketing — tiers, early bird pricing, promotion timeline, and attendee communications |
| `/collect-from-group` | Creates a group payment collection page — cost splitting, launch messages, and a reminder cadence so you don't have to chase people |
| `/weekly-checkin` | Weekly health check with a content calendar and specific action items |
| `/boost-campaign` | Diagnoses a stalled campaign and gives you a 7-day rescue plan |
| `/thank-donors` | Generates personalized thank-you messages for every supporter tier |

You can also just describe your situation in plain language — Claude will figure out which skills to use.

**Example prompts:**
- *"My neighbor's house burned down. Help me raise $15,000 for her family."*
- *"I'm organizing a charity golf tournament for 120 people. Help me set up ticketing."*
- *"I need to collect $200 from each of 25 teammates for new uniforms."*
- *"My campaign has been live 2 weeks and donations have stalled. What do I do?"*
- *"Write a week's worth of social posts for my campaign — we just hit 50%."*
- *"I have 80 donors I haven't thanked yet. Help me fix that."*

### Components

**Skills** (`skills/`) — Six workflow skills covering fundraisers, events, and group collections. Each includes a `SKILL.md` with detailed instructions and a `references/` folder of supporting data.

**Commands** (`commands/`) — Six slash commands for common workflows. Direct entry points without needing to describe what you want.

**Agents** (`agents/`) — Six autonomous subagents for heavier tasks. Claude spawns these automatically for batch work, deep analysis, or large-scale content generation.

### Reference files

Each skill pulls from reference documents that encode research and best practices:

**Fundraising:**
- [story-templates.md](skills/campaign-creation/references/story-templates.md) — Category-specific story frameworks
- [title-formulas.md](skills/campaign-creation/references/title-formulas.md) — Proven title formulas with scoring
- [post-templates.md](skills/campaign-promotion/references/post-templates.md) — Platform-specific social post templates
- [email-sequences.md](skills/campaign-promotion/references/email-sequences.md) — Full email drip sequences
- [thank-you-templates.md](skills/donor-engagement/references/thank-you-templates.md) — Thank-you messages by donor tier
- [update-templates.md](skills/donor-engagement/references/update-templates.md) — Campaign update templates
- [benchmark-data.md](skills/campaign-analytics/references/benchmark-data.md) — Category benchmarks and KPIs
- [optimization-checklist.md](skills/campaign-analytics/references/optimization-checklist.md) — Full optimization checklist

**Events:**
- [ticket-strategy.md](skills/event-management/references/ticket-strategy.md) — Ticket tier templates, early bird formulas, group discounts
- [attendee-templates.md](skills/event-management/references/attendee-templates.md) — Registration to post-event communication templates

**Group Collections:**
- [collection-templates.md](skills/group-collection/references/collection-templates.md) — Launch messages, reminders, and category-specific templates
- [cost-splitting-guide.md](skills/group-collection/references/cost-splitting-guide.md) — Fixed, tiered, and flexible split models with fee transparency

### Research behind the plugin

The recommendations encoded in this plugin are drawn from analysis of crowdfunding campaign data:

- Campaigns with co-organizers are 3x more likely to reach their goal
- Each new sharing method increases visibility 2.5x
- Video increases funds raised by up to 4x
- Titles containing "help" succeed 30% more often
- Goals under $5,000 are 2.5x more likely to succeed
- Raising 20–30% in the first week correlates with 80% higher success rate
- Campaign updates increase donation likelihood by 40%
- Optimal campaign description length: ~150 words
