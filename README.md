## Overview

This plugin turns Claude into a full-service fundraising coach and campaign manager. It encodes the strategies used by the top-performing crowdfunding organizers and makes them accessible to anyone through conversation.

Based on research analyzing millions of crowdfunding campaigns, only ~27% reach their goal. The difference comes down to repeatable behaviors most organizers don't do because they lack the time or skills. This plugin closes that gap.
