## What It Does

Once installed, the plugin gives Claude four commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/campaign` | Walks you through building any campaign from scratch — fundraiser, event, or group — with story, title, goal, ticketing, cost-splitting, and launch strategy |
| `/promote` | Generates a complete promotion package: platform-specific social posts, email sequences, content calendar, and SEO recommendations |
| `/check-in` | Health check on any active campaign with a score, diagnosis, and specific action items |
| `/engage` | Generates personalized messages for supporters — thank-yous, updates, re-engagement, share requests, and unpaid member follow-ups |

You can also just describe your situation in plain language — Claude will figure out which skills to use.

**Example prompts:**
- *"My neighbor's house burned down. Help me raise $15,000 for her family."*
- *"I'm organizing a charity golf tournament for 120 people. Help me set up ticketing."*
- *"I need to collect $200 from each of 25 teammates for new uniforms."*
- *"My campaign has been live 2 weeks and donations have stalled. What do I do?"*
- *"Write a week's worth of social posts for my campaign — we just hit 50%."*
- *"I have 80 donors I haven't thanked yet. Help me fix that."*

### Components

**Skills** (`skills/`) — Five workflow skills covering all campaign types. `campaign-context` is a shared context-gathering engine invoked by every command. The remaining four map to the four commands.

**Commands** (`commands/`) — Four slash commands for common workflows. Direct entry points without needing to describe what you want.

**Agents** (`agents/`) — Three autonomous subagents for heavier tasks. Claude spawns these automatically for batch work, deep analysis, or large-scale content generation.

### Reference files

Each skill pulls from reference documents that encode research and best practices:

**Campaign creation:**
- [story-templates.md](plugin/skills/campaign-creation/references/story-templates.md) — Category-specific story frameworks
- [title-formulas.md](plugin/skills/campaign-creation/references/title-formulas.md) — Proven title formulas with scoring
- [ticket-strategy.md](plugin/skills/campaign-creation/references/ticket-strategy.md) — Ticket type templates, early bird formulas, group discounts
- [cost-splitting-guide.md](plugin/skills/campaign-creation/references/cost-splitting-guide.md) — Fixed, tiered, and flexible split models with fee transparency

**Promotion:**
- [post-templates.md](plugin/skills/campaign-promotion/references/post-templates.md) — Platform-specific social post templates
- [email-sequences.md](plugin/skills/campaign-promotion/references/email-sequences.md) — Full email drip sequences

**Analytics:**
- [benchmark-data.md](plugin/skills/campaign-analytics/references/benchmark-data.md) — Category benchmarks and KPIs
- [optimization-checklist.md](plugin/skills/campaign-analytics/references/optimization-checklist.md) — Full optimization checklist

**Supporter engagement:**
- [thank-you-templates.md](plugin/skills/supporter-engagement/references/thank-you-templates.md) — Thank-you messages by tier and campaign type
- [update-templates.md](plugin/skills/supporter-engagement/references/update-templates.md) — Campaign update templates
- [reminder-templates.md](plugin/skills/supporter-engagement/references/reminder-templates.md) — Group reminder cadences, re-engagement, and celebration templates

### Research behind the plugin

The recommendations encoded in this plugin are drawn from analysis of crowdfunding campaign data:

- Campaigns with co-organizers are 3x more likely to reach their goal
- Each new sharing method increases visibility 2.5x
- Video increases funds raised by up to 4x
- Titles containing "help" succeed 30% more often
- Goals under $5,000 are 2.5x more likely to succeed
- Raising 20-30% in the first week correlates with 80% higher success rate
- Campaign updates increase donation likelihood by 40%
- Optimal campaign description length: ~150 words
