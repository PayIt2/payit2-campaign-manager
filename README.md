# PayIt2 Campaign Manager

> An AI plugin for Claude that turns any conversation into a full-service fundraising coach. Create campaigns, generate promotion content, engage donors, and optimize performance — all through natural conversation.

**Works with:** [Claude desktop app](https://claude.ai/download) (free) · Claude Code CLI

---

## For Users: How to Install

This plugin works inside **Claude**, Anthropic's free AI assistant. You don't need to be technical to use it.

### Option 1: Claude Desktop App (recommended)

1. Download the free [Claude desktop app](https://claude.ai/download)
2. Open Claude and type `/plugin`
3. Go to the **Discover** tab and search for **PayIt2 Campaign Manager**
4. Click **Install**
5. Start a conversation — say *"Help me create a fundraising campaign"* and Claude will guide you

> The plugin is not yet listed in the marketplace. [Create a free PayIt2 account](https://www.payit2.com/register) and we'll notify you the moment it's available.

### Option 2: Claude.ai (browser)

Same steps as above, from [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) in your browser once the plugin is listed.

## What It Does

Once installed, the plugin gives Claude four core capabilities:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/launch-campaign` | Walks you through building a campaign from scratch — story, title, goal, photos, and strategy |
| `/weekly-checkin` | Weekly health check with a content calendar and specific action items |
| `/boost-campaign` | Diagnoses a stalled campaign and gives you a 7-day rescue plan |
| `/thank-donors` | Generates personalized thank-you messages for every donor tier |

You can also just describe your situation in plain language — Claude will figure out which skills to use.

**Example prompts:**
- *"My neighbor's house burned down. Help me raise $15,000 for her family."*
- *"My campaign has been live 2 weeks and donations have stalled. What do I do?"*
- *"Write a week's worth of social posts for my campaign — we just hit 50%."*
- *"I have 80 donors I haven't thanked yet. Help me fix that."*

### Components

**Skills** (`skills/`) — Four campaign workflow skills. Each includes a `SKILL.md` with detailed instructions and a `references/` folder of supporting data Claude reads during execution.

**Commands** (`commands/`) — Four slash commands that map to the skills above. Slash commands give users a direct entry point without needing to describe what they want.

**Agents** (`agents/`) — Four autonomous subagents for heavier tasks. Claude spawns these automatically for batch work, deep analysis, or large-scale content generation.

### Reference files

Each skill pulls from reference documents that encode campaign research and best practices:

- [story-templates.md](skills/campaign-creation/references/story-templates.md) — Category-specific story frameworks
- [title-formulas.md](skills/campaign-creation/references/title-formulas.md) — Proven title formulas with scoring
- [post-templates.md](skills/campaign-promotion/references/post-templates.md) — Platform-specific social post templates
- [email-sequences.md](skills/campaign-promotion/references/email-sequences.md) — Full email drip sequences
- [thank-you-templates.md](skills/donor-engagement/references/thank-you-templates.md) — Thank-you messages by donor tier
- [update-templates.md](skills/donor-engagement/references/update-templates.md) — Campaign update templates
- [benchmark-data.md](skills/campaign-analytics/references/benchmark-data.md) — Category benchmarks and KPIs
- [optimization-checklist.md](skills/campaign-analytics/references/optimization-checklist.md) — Full optimization checklist

### Research behind the plugin

The recommendations encoded in this plugin are drawn from analysis of crowdfunding campaign data:

- Campaigns with co-organizers are 3x more likely to reach their goal
- Each new sharing method increases visibility 2.5x
- Video increases funds raised by up to 4x
- Titles containing "help" succeed 30% more often
- Goals under $5,000 are 2.5x more likely to succeed
- Raising 20–30% in the first week correlates with 80% higher success rate
- Campaign updates increase donation likelihood by 40%
- Optimal campaign description length: ~150 words
