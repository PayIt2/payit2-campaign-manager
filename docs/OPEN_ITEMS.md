Outstanding work for the PayIt2 Campaign Assistant Claude plugin.

---

- [ ] **Connect to live PayIt2 API** — Plugin currently uses static reference data. Wire skills and agents to live campaign data via PayIt2 REST API once it's deployed.
- [ ] **MCP server integration** — Align plugin with the PayIt2 MCP Server spec (v1.0) in `payit2-business/platform/specs/`.
- [ ] **Publish to Claude plugin directory** — After API integration is complete.
- [ ] **Terminology: "Supporters" → "Participants"** — Skill names (`supporter-engagement`), agent names (`supporter-outreach`), and command descriptions still use "supporters." Per PLATFORM-STANDARDS section 16, the correct term is "Participants." Rename skills, agents, file names, and all references.
