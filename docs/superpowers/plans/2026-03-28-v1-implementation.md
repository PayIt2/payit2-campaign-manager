# Campaign Coach v1.0.0 Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Rebuild the Campaign Coach plugin from fundraising-first to a unified platform supporting fundraisers, events, and group collections across all commands, skills, and agents.

**Architecture:** 4 unified commands → 5 type-adaptive skills → 3 agents. Every component branches on campaign type internally rather than having separate type-specific components. A new `campaign-context` skill handles all context-gathering conversationally (no MCP this release).

**Tech Stack:** Claude plugin markdown files (SKILL.md, command .md, agent .md), plugin.json manifest, build-plugin.sh zip builder.

name: campaign-context
description: >
  Shared context-gathering engine used by all Campaign Coach commands. Use when

version: 1.0.0
---

# Campaign Context

Gather the minimum context needed for the current command through natural conversation. Never ask for more than what the current task requires.

## Context Model

| Field | Needed By | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Campaign type (fundraiser / event / collection) | All commands | Always required first |
| Title | All commands | Required |
| URL (if live) | /promote, /check-in, /engage | Optional — extract what you can from URL structure |
| Goal / target amount | /campaign, /check-in | Required for fundraiser and collection |
| Ticket tiers / pricing | /campaign, /check-in | Required for events |
| Current progress (amount raised / tickets sold / payments received) | /check-in, /engage | Required for check-in |
| Days active / days until deadline or event | /check-in, /promote | Required for check-in |
| Audience description | /promote, /campaign | Optional |
| Channels used so far | /promote, /check-in | Optional |
| Group size | /campaign, /check-in | Required for collections |

## Context-Gathering Rules

1. **Type first.** Always establish campaign type before asking anything else. Ask: "What are you working on — a fundraiser, an event, or a group collection?"

2. **Minimum viable context.** Ask only what the current command needs. /promote needs type + title + what's been tried. /engage needs type + what action the user wants to take. Don't ask for a full data dump.

3. **Accept a URL shortcut.** If the user provides a PayIt2 page URL, acknowledge it and ask for the 1-2 things the URL can't tell you (e.g., current progress stats for /check-in).

4. **Use what's in the conversation.** If campaign type and title were established earlier in the conversation, don't ask again. Reference what you already know: "Got it — continuing with your [title] [type]."

5. **One question at a time.** Never ask multiple questions in one message. Pick the most important unknown and ask just that.

## Context Questions by Command

### /campaign (Create & Launch)
Required: campaign type, then branch into type-specific story interview (see campaign-creation skill).

### /promote (Drive Traffic)
Ask in order, stopping when you have enough:
1. "Tell me about your campaign — what type is it and what's the title?"
2. "Do you have a PayIt2 URL for it yet?"
3. "How long has it been live and what promotion have you tried so far?"

### /check-in (Health Check)
Ask in order:
1. "What type of campaign is it and what's the title?"
2. Then by type:
   - **Fundraiser:** "Share your current numbers — amount raised, number of donors, and how many days it's been live."
   - **Event:** "Share your numbers — tickets sold, total capacity, and how many days until the event."
   - **Collection:** "Share your numbers — how many people have paid, total group size, and days until the deadline."
3. "What channels have you been using to promote it?"

### /engage (Supporter Relationships)
1. "What type of campaign is it?"
2. "What would you like to do — thank supporters, post an update, re-engage lapsed supporters, or ask for shares?"
3. Follow up with only what's needed for that action.

## MCP-Readiness Note

This skill is the adapter layer for a future MCP integration. When a PayIt2 MCP server is added, this skill will query it for campaign data instead of prompting the user. All other skills remain unchanged — they receive context the same way regardless of source.

# Campaign Creation

Guide organizers through building a high-converting campaign page on PayIt2.com. Works for all three campaign types: fundraisers, events, and group collections. Every element — title, description, visuals, goal/pricing — directly impacts whether the campaign reaches its target.

## Step 1: Story / Details Interview

Conduct a structured interview adapted to campaign type. Ask questions one at a time, building on each answer.

### Fundraiser Interview
1. **Who needs help?** Name, relationship, one humanizing detail.
2. **What happened?** The specific situation in their own words.
3. **What do the funds cover?** Specific, tangible line items (medical bills, legal fees, rent).
4. **What's the timeline?** Urgency — court dates, medical deadlines, eviction notices.
5. **What happens without help?** The stakes and consequences.
6. **Who is already helping?** Co-organizers, community support, existing efforts.

### Event Interview
1. **What type of event is it?** Category (conference, party, concert, reunion, etc.) and brief description.
2. **When and where?** Date, start/end time, timezone, venue name and address (or virtual platform).
3. **What's the capacity?** Max attendees. Separate by tier if applicable.
4. **What will attendees experience?** Agenda, speakers, activities, food/drink, entertainment.
5. **What do attendees need to know?** Dress code, what to bring, accessibility, age restrictions, refund policy.

### Collection Interview
1. **What's the collection for?** Specific purpose — team jerseys, cabin rental, birthday gift, club dues, etc.
2. **How many people are in the group?** Exact or estimated headcount.
3. **What's the total amount needed?** Real number including buffer for fees.
4. **What's the deadline?** When does the money need to be collected and why.
5. **Fixed, tiered, or flexible?** Equal split, different levels (room types, meal options), or suggested amount.

## Step 2: Title Generation

Generate 5 title options scored on three dimensions:

| Dimension | What to optimize for |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Clarity | Reader understands the situation in under 10 words |
| Emotional impact | For fundraisers: names the person or starts with "Help"/"Support". For events: conveys energy/excitement. For collections: clear purpose. |
| SEO value | Includes searchable terms for the campaign category |

Titles must be under 60 characters. Always include at least one option with the key proper noun (person's name, event name, group name).

**Fundraiser title formulas:**
- "Help [Name] [Situation]" — e.g., "Help Maria Cover Her Medical Bills"
- "[Name]'s [Situation] Fund" — e.g., "Jake's Legal Defense Fund"
- "Support [Name] Through [Situation]" — e.g., "Support the Rivera Family After the Fire"

**Event title formulas:**
- "[Event Name] [Year/Edition]" — e.g., "Riverside Reunion 2026"
- "[Group] Annual [Type]" — e.g., "Springfield Soccer Club Annual Banquet"
- "[Descriptor] [Event Type]" — e.g., "Summer Block Party & Cookout"

**Collection title formulas:**
- "[Group Name] [Purpose] Collection" — e.g., "Soccer Team Spring Jersey Order"
- "[Group] [Purpose] Fund" — e.g., "Johnson Family Reunion Cabin Fund"
- "[Purpose] for [Group]" — e.g., "Trip Costs for Class of 2010 Reunion"

## Step 3: Description Writing

### Fundraiser: Hook → Person → Situation → Plan → Ask (~150 words)
1. **Hook** (1-2 sentences): Open with the most urgent, emotional fact. Stop the scroll.
2. **Person** (2-3 sentences): Humanize the beneficiary. Name, character, what they mean to people.
3. **Situation** (3-4 sentences): What happened and why funds are needed. Be specific with amounts.
4. **Plan** (2-3 sentences): How the money will be used. Break down the budget simply.
5. **Ask** (1-2 sentences): Direct CTA. "Any amount helps. Please share."

Target 100-150 words. Shorter descriptions convert better than long ones.

### Event: Hook → What/When/Where → Who → Included → Schedule → Logistics (<200 words)
1. **Hook** (1-2 sentences): Most exciting thing about the event. What makes it unmissable?
2. **What / When / Where** (2-3 sentences): Core logistics in plain language.
3. **Who it's for** (1-2 sentences): Help the right people self-select. "Perfect for..."
4. **What's included** (bullet list): Everything the ticket covers.
5. **Schedule / Agenda** (if applicable): Time blocks so attendees can plan.
6. **Logistics** (1-2 sentences): Parking, transit, what to bring.
7. **CTA** (1 sentence): "Grab your tickets before early bird ends."

Use bullet points and headers for scannability. Target under 200 words.

### Collection: Purpose → Amount Breakdown → Deadline → How to Pay (~75 words)
1. **Purpose** (1-2 sentences): What this collection is for, clearly.
2. **Amount** (1-2 sentences): How much each person owes and what it covers.
3. **Deadline** (1 sentence): When payment is due and why (ties to a real constraint).
4. **How to pay** (1 sentence): Direct CTA — "Click the button above to pay your share."

Keep it under 100 words. Collections are transactional — clarity beats storytelling.

## Step 4: Visual Strategy

### Fundraiser
- **Primary photo**: Beneficiary's face. Authentic > polished. Appears in every share preview.
- **Supporting photos**: Before/after, family moments, community support.
- **Video**: 60-90 second personal appeal increases donations by up to 4x. Offer to write the script.

### Event
- **Hero image**: Single most compelling photo or graphic. Must convey energy at thumbnail size.
- **Event photos**: Past event photos showing crowds and real moments.
- **Venue photos**: Help attendees visualize where they're going.
- **Branded graphics**: Date and location on every graphic.
- **Speaker/performer headshots**: If lineup sells the event, show the faces.

### Collection
- **Hero image**: Group photo or relevant visual (jersey, cabin, trophy). Friendly > formal.
- Keep visuals simple — collections are functional. Don't over-invest in production.

## Step 5: Goal / Pricing Setup

### Fundraiser Goal Psychology
- Goals under **$5,000** are 2.5x more likely to succeed
- Raising **20-30% in week 1** makes success 80% more likely
- Start conservative — can always increase after hitting milestones (social proof accelerates)
- Compare to category: Legal defense $5K-$25K average; medical $10K-$50K average; emergency $2K-$8K average

### Event Ticket Tier Design
- Design **2-4 tiers** with **20-25% price gaps** between them
- **Early bird**: 25-30% off regular price, first 30% of capacity, 7-14 day window
- **Group discounts**: 5+ tickets = 10% off; 10+ tickets = 15% off; 20+ tickets = 20% off
- Standard structure:

| Tier | Pricing | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Early Bird | 25-30% off regular | Reward early commitment, generate social proof |
| Regular | Base price | Standard access |
| VIP/Premium | 50-100% above regular | Priority access, perks, exclusivity |

### Collection Cost Models
- **Fixed split**: Total ÷ headcount = per-person amount. Round up $1-2 to buffer fees.
- **Tiered options**: Different levels for different participation (room types, meal choices, activity packages).
- **Flexible/voluntary**: Set a suggested amount prominently. Best for group gifts.

## Step 6: Pre-Publish Checklist

# Ticket Strategy

Tier structure, pricing formulas, and group discount models for event campaigns on PayIt2.

## Tier Design Principles

Design 2-4 tiers with 20-25% price gaps. The gap must feel meaningful (worth upgrading) but not so large that regular tickets feel inadequate.

### Minimum Viable Tier Structure (2 tiers)
| Tier | Price | Allocation |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Early Bird | 70-75% of regular price | First 25-30% of capacity |
| Regular | Base price | Remaining capacity |

### Standard Tier Structure (3 tiers)
| Tier | Price | Allocation | What's included |
|------|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Early Bird | 70-75% of regular | First 30% of capacity | Same access, reward for commitment |
| Regular | Base price | Core capacity | Standard event access |
| VIP | 150-200% of regular | 10-15% of capacity | Priority seating, exclusive perks |

### Full Tier Structure (4 tiers)
| Tier | Price example (base $100) | Notes |
|------|--------------------------|-------|
| Early Bird | $70 | 7-14 day window only |
| Regular | $100 | Core offering |
| VIP | $150 | Premium access |
| Table / Group | $400 (5 seats) | ~20% discount for groups |

## Early Bird Strategy

- **Discount**: 25-30% off regular price
- **Allocation**: First 25-30% of total capacity
- **Window**: 7-14 days from announcement
- **Urgency messaging**: Show exact count ("47 of 100 early bird spots remaining")
- **Purpose**: Generates early revenue + social proof that drives regular sales

## Group Discount Structure

| Group size | Discount per ticket |
|-----------|-------------------|
| 5-9 tickets | 10% off |
| 10-19 tickets | 15% off |
| 20+ tickets | 20% off |

Group discounts turn one buyer into a table, a team, or a section. Always offer them — the volume makes up for the discount.

## Pricing Formulas

**Cost-plus pricing** (for revenue events):
> Minimum viable ticket price = (Total costs ÷ Expected attendance) × 1.3 (30% margin)

**Market-rate pricing** (for social/community events):
> Research 3 comparable events in your area. Price Early Bird 20% below the median, Regular at median, VIP 50% above.

**Break-even check**:
> Break-even point = Fixed costs ÷ (Ticket price - Variable cost per attendee)

## Template: Reunion Event
- Early Bird (first 30 days): $45
- Regular: $65
- VIP (includes dinner seating + keepsake): $95
- Table of 8 (regular): $440 (~$55/person, ~15% group discount)

## Template: Conference/Workshop
- Early Bird (first 2 weeks): $149
- Regular: $199
- VIP (front row + networking dinner + recording): $299
- Group (5+): 15% off per ticket

## Template: Community Party/Fundraiser
- Early Bird (first week): $25
- Regular: $35
- VIP (premium open bar + priority entry): $55

## Key Statistics
- Early bird tiers: **30% of capacity** sold before regular pricing opens
- BOGO offers: **2.2x more tickets** than standard pricing
- Group discounts: increase average order value by **40-60%**
- Events with 2+ tiers: **35% higher revenue** than single-price events

# Cost-Splitting Guide

Models, formulas, and fee transparency guidance for group collection campaigns on PayIt2.

## The Three Models

### Model 1: Fixed Per-Person Split
Everyone pays the same amount. Best for dues, equal-benefit expenses, uniform orders.

**Formula**: Total cost ÷ group size = per-person amount. Round UP to the nearest dollar.

| Total Cost | Group Size | Per Person (exact) | Per Person (rounded up) |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| $500 | 10 | $50.00 | $50 |
| $720 | 12 | $60.00 | $60 |
| $1,100 | 15 | $73.33 | $74 |
| $2,400 | 20 | $120.00 | $120 |
| $3,500 | 28 | $125.00 | $125 |

**Buffer recommendation**: Add $2-5 per person to cover PayIt2 processing fees and potential no-shows. If you collect a surplus, return it or roll it to the next collection — never quietly keep it.

### Model 2: Tiered Options
Different levels for different participation. Best for trips with room choices, events with meal options, equipment with size/quantity variations.

**Example — Weekend Trip:**
- Shared room (2-3 per room): $150/person
- Private room: $250/person
- Day-tripper (no overnight): $75/person

**Example — Club Dinner:**
- Standard meal: $45/person
- Vegetarian meal: $45/person
- Meal + open bar: $70/person

Set each tier as a separate payment option on the collection page with clear, unambiguous labels.

### Model 3: Flexible / Voluntary
Suggested amount with room to adjust. Best for group gifts, community projects, optional contributions.

**How to set it up:**
- State the suggested amount prominently in the description: "We're suggesting $25 per person."
- Set the page goal to the full amount (suggested amount × group size).
- Leave payment amount open so contributors can give more or less.
- Never pressure people who give less than suggested.

## Fee Transparency

Always be upfront about PayIt2's processing fees. Include one of these in your collection description:

> "The collection goal of $X includes a small amount to cover payment processing fees."

> "Per-person amount is $Y. This includes a $1-2 buffer to cover transaction fees."

Contributors hate surprise fees. Transparency prevents friction and complaints.

## Handling Overages

If you collect more than needed:
1. **Announce the surplus** to the group: "We hit $1,340 — $40 over our goal!"
2. **Options**: (a) Roll to next collection, (b) reduce everyone's balance proportionally, (c) donate the remainder to a related cause, (d) cover incidentals without asking for more money.
3. **Never keep it silently.** Trust is the organizer's most valuable asset.

## Handling Shortfalls

If the deadline passes and you're short:
1. **Assess the gap**: Is it 5% short or 30% short? Different responses.
2. **Small gap (<10%)**: Absorb it if possible, or ask the group once to cover the difference.
3. **Large gap (>10%)**: Renegotiate with the vendor, reduce scope, or extend the deadline with a clear explanation to the group.
4. **Non-payers**: Follow up via private message only. Never name non-payers to the group.

## Best Practices

1. **Pay your own share first.** Sets the norm, demonstrates commitment.
2. **Show the math.** Break down exactly what the money covers. Transparency drives participation.
3. **Round amounts to clean numbers.** $53.33 per person creates friction. $55 doesn't.
4. **Build in a buffer.** Better to return money than beg for more.
5. **Set deadlines with real constraints.** "Booking closes Friday" beats "please pay soon."
6. **Name the deadline in the title or description.** It gets attention.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why it hurts | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| No stated deadline | Slow payment rate | Tie deadline to a real booking or order cutoff |
| Exact split with no buffer | Shortfall from fees | Round up $1-2 per person |
| Vague description | Confusion, complaints | Itemize costs in the description |
| Too many reminders | Annoys the group | Max 5-6 messages total to full group |
| Public call-outs of non-payers | Damages relationships | Private follow-up only, after deadline |

# Campaign Promotion

Guide organizers through multi-channel promotion for any campaign type. Under-promotion is the #1 reason campaigns fail. This skill turns promotion into a systematic process regardless of whether you're running a fundraiser, event, or group collection.

## Core Principle: The 2.5x Rule

Each new sharing method used leads to a **2.5x increase in campaign visibility**. Organizers who share through 6+ methods receive **3x more engagement**. Maximize channel diversity and posting frequency.

## Channel Priority by Campaign Type

### Fundraiser: Lead with Personal Networks
| Channel | Priority | Why |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Facebook | High | Broad reach, emotional content performs well |
| Personal text/WhatsApp | High | Highest conversion rate (inner circle) |
| Email | High | Best per-contact conversion for direct asks |
| Instagram | Medium | Visual storytelling, younger demographics |
| TikTok | Medium | Viral potential for emotional stories |
| Twitter/X | Medium | News-driven, legal/political causes |
| Nextdoor | Low-Medium | Local causes, neighborhood impact |
| LinkedIn | Low | Professional networks, legal defense cases |

### Event: Lead with Social Discovery
| Channel | Priority | Why |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Instagram | High | Visual, shareable, event discovery |
| Facebook Events | High | Native event feature, community reach |
| TikTok | High | Countdown content, FOMO, viral potential |
| Email | High | Confirmed buyers share more after registration |
| Community boards | Medium | Nextdoor, local Facebook Groups |
| LinkedIn | Medium | Professional/industry events |
| Partner cross-promotion | High | Other organizations with same audience |

### Collection: Lead with Direct Messaging
| Channel | Priority | Why |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Group text / WhatsApp group | High | Where the group already communicates |
| Email | High | Formal, easy to reply and ask questions |
| Slack / Teams | High | Work or club groups |
| Facebook Group | Medium | If the group has one |
| Social media | Low | Collections are private; public posts have low ROI |

## Content Calendar Frameworks

### Fundraiser: 4 Phases over 30 Days

**Phase 1 — Launch Blitz (Days 1-3)**
- Day 1 AM: Announcement on all primary channels
- Day 1 PM: Personal text/WhatsApp to inner circle (10-20 people)
- Day 1 Evening: Email blast to full contact list
- Day 2: Video content — personal appeal or behind-the-scenes

## Content Rotation Angles

Rotate through these 8 angles to keep promotion fresh (all types have equivalents):

| Angle | Fundraiser | Event | Collection |
|-------|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Story / Announcement | Full situation explanation | What, when, where, why it matters | What this is for and how it works |
| Person / Lineup | Humanize the beneficiary | Speakers, performers, organizers | Group context, who's involved |
| Progress | Milestone celebrations | Tickets sold milestones | Payment progress ("12 of 20 paid!") |
| Gratitude | Thanking donors publicly | Thanking registrants and partners | Thanking those who've paid |
| Urgency | Deadline / remaining gap | Countdown / scarcity | Deadline / payment needed |
| Impact | How funds are being used | What attendees will experience | What the collected funds enable |
| Ask | Direct donation request | Direct ticket purchase prompt | Direct payment request |
| Share | Ask supporters to spread word | Ask registrants to bring friends | N/A (collections are private) |

## Platform-Specific Formatting

- **Facebook**: 2-3 paragraphs, emotional hook, photo, direct link + CTA at end
- **Instagram**: Caption under 125 words before fold, 5-10 relevant hashtags, Story version with link sticker
- **TikTok**: 60-90 second script, hook in first 3 seconds, authentic > polished
- **Twitter/X**: Under 280 chars or thread format, punchy, link in reply (fundraisers/events only)

- **Text/WhatsApp**: Under 160 chars + link, extremely personal, one clear ask

## Email Outreach Tiers

| Tier | Audience | Ask | Style |
|------|----------|-----|-------|
| 1 — Inner circle | Family, close friends | Specific dollar amount + share / buy a ticket / pay now | Deeply personal, first-person |
| 2 — Extended network | Colleagues, acquaintances | General support + share | Warm, broader appeal |
| 3 — Community | Local groups, organizations | Share first, act if moved | Community-framing, impact-focused |
| 4 — Cold outreach | Media, influencers, orgs | Coverage or signal boost | Professional pitch, newsworthy angle |

## Key Statistics

# Campaign Analytics

Diagnose campaign health, identify bottlenecks, and prescribe specific actions — for fundraisers, events, and group collections. This skill turns raw campaign data into actionable coaching.

## Health Score Formula

Calculate a 0-100 health score using type-specific weights:

### Fundraiser Weights
| Factor | Weight | What to measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Momentum | 25% | Donation velocity vs. >2/day target in week 1 |
| Social reach | 20% | Shares, unique visitors, share-to-visit ratio |
| Story quality | 15% | Description length, photo present, video present, title strength |
| Donor engagement | 15% | Thank-you rate, update frequency, donor return rate |
| Goal progress | 15% | % of goal reached vs. days active |
| Network activation | 10% | Co-organizer count, email list usage, channel diversity |

### Event Weights
| Factor | Weight | What to measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Registration velocity | 25% | % of capacity sold per week (healthy: 10-15%/week) |
| Capacity utilization | 20% | % of total capacity sold (target 80%+ by event date) |
| Promotion reach | 20% | Channels active, partner cross-promotion, share rate |
| Engagement | 15% | Registrant-to-sharer ratio (target: 1 in 5 registrants shares) |
| Revenue | 10% | Revenue vs. break-even vs. goal |
| Logistics readiness | 10% | Communication cadence, confirmation emails set up |

### Collection Weights
| Factor | Weight | What to measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Payment rate | 30% | % of group that has paid (target: 80%+ by deadline) |
| Deadline proximity | 20% | Days remaining vs. payment rate (are you on pace?) |
| Communication cadence | 20% | Reminder timing following Friendly Collector framework |
| Response rate | 15% | % who respond to messages (even "I'll pay soon" counts) |
| Transparency | 15% | Cost breakdown visible, progress updates shared |

## Score Interpretation (All Types)

| Score | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 80-100 | Thriving | Maintain cadence, expand to new channels |
| 60-79 | Healthy | Address 1-2 weak areas, increase promotion |
| 40-59 | At risk | Significant changes needed — dispatch campaign-coach agent |
| 20-39 | Critical | Major intervention — dispatch campaign-coach agent |
| 0-19 | Stalled | Consider relaunch or pivot |

## Diagnostic Framework

When an organizer asks "why isn't this working?" run through all 3 stages:

### Stage 1: Traffic Diagnosis
**Question**: Are people seeing the campaign?

- Fundraiser: page views, shares, channel diversity
- Event: registration page visits, social reach, partner posts
- Collection: did launch message reach all group members?

**If traffic is low**: Problem is promotion, not the page. Reference campaign-promotion skill.

### Stage 2: Conversion Diagnosis
**Question**: Are visitors taking action?

- Fundraiser: visit-to-donation rate (healthy: 5-15%), avg donation $35-75
- Event: visit-to-registration rate (healthy: 15-25%), ticket tier distribution
- Collection: payment rate per reminder sent (should increase after each message)

**If traffic is fine but conversion is low**: Problem is the page. Reference campaign-creation skill.

### Stage 3: Engagement Diagnosis
**Question**: Are supporters becoming advocates?

- Fundraiser: donor-to-sharer ratio (target >15%), update frequency
- Event: registrant-to-sharer ratio (target: 1 in 5), re-share content posted
- Collection: did payers bring peer pressure? Are non-payers responding to reminders?

**If conversion is fine but growth has stalled**: Problem is engagement loop. Reference supporter-engagement skill.

## Type-Specific KPIs

### Fundraiser KPIs
| KPI | Formula | Target |
|-----|---------|--------|
| Donation velocity | Donations per day | >2/day in week 1 |
| Share rate | Shares / page views | >5% |
| Conversion rate | Donations / unique visitors | 5-15% |
| Average donation | Total raised / donor count | $35-$75 |
| Donor-to-sharer ratio | Sharers / donors | >15% |
| Update frequency | Updates / weeks active | >1/week |
| Time to first donation | Hours from launch to first gift | <4 hours |

### Event KPIs
| KPI | Healthy Range | Warning Sign |
|-----|--------------|--------------|
| Registration velocity | 10-15% of capacity/week | <5% after launch week |
| Capacity utilization | On track to 80%+ by event | <50% at midpoint |
| Early bird conversion | 25-35% of total tickets | <15% |
| Ticket tier distribution | Even spread across tiers | >80% in cheapest tier |
| Registrant share rate | 1 in 5 registrants shares | <1 in 10 |
| Email open rate | 40-60% | <25% |

### Collection KPIs
| KPI | Healthy | Warning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| Payment rate at midpoint | >50% paid | <30% paid |
| Payment rate at deadline | >80% paid | <60% paid |
| Response rate to messages | >70% (paid or acknowledged) | <40% |
| Days to full collection | 2-3 weeks from launch | >4 weeks with <80% paid |

## Optimization Playbook by Effort

### Quick Wins (do today — all types)
- Fundraiser: Add/improve primary photo, shorten description to <150 words, add co-organizer, thank unthanked donors, post one update
- Event: Post urgency content (seats remaining, days left), send reminder to opened-but-didn't-buy email segment, update hero image
- Collection: Send a progress update to the group, privately follow up with 1-2 non-payers

### Medium Effort (this week)
- Fundraiser: Record and upload video (4x more funds), send personalized emails to top 20 contacts, create content for 3+ social channels
- Event: Activate partner cross-promotion, create social proof content ("X registrants"), launch group discount offer
- Collection: Add a co-collector, extend deadline with real-constraint framing, restructure payment tier if response is concentrated in one option

### Strategic Moves (campaign is stalled)
- Fundraiser: Rewrite title (test 3 options), refresh full description, pitch local media
- Event: Consider price adjustment, add a new tier, reach out to complementary organizations for cross-promotion
- Collection: One-on-one outreach to every non-payer, consider scope reduction to match actual payment rate

# Supporter Engagement

Build lasting supporter relationships across all campaign types. Engaged supporters share, re-engage, and recruit — this is a massive competitive advantage most organizers ignore.

## The Supporter Lifecycle (All Types)

```
FIRST ACTION → THANK YOU → UPDATE → RE-ENGAGE → ADVOCATE
(donation/registration/payment)  (<1 hr)  (regular)  (milestone)  (ongoing)
```

## Thank-You System

### Timing Rules
- **Within 1 hour**: Personalized thank-you (highest impact window)
- **Within 24 hours**: Public acknowledgment (social post or campaign update)
- **Within 1 week**: Impact update showing how their support is being put to work

### Personalization Tiers (Fundraisers)
| Tier | Range | Style | Length |
|------|-------|-------|--------|
| Micro | $1-$25 | Warm, "every dollar matters" | 2-3 sentences |
| Standard | $26-$100 | Personal, specific impact of their amount | 3-4 sentences |
| Major | $101-$500 | Deeply personal, name how their gift moves the needle | 4-5 sentences |
| Anchor | $500+ | Full personal letter, reference relationship if known | Full letter |

### Equivalents for Other Types
- **Event attendees**: Thank for registering. Treat ticket price as proxy for tier — match enthusiasm to price paid.
- **Group members who paid**: Thank for paying on time, frame as contributing to a shared goal. No tiers needed — a warm, brief message for everyone is appropriate.

### Thank-You Framework (All Types)
1. **Name them**: First name always. Never "Dear Supporter."
2. **Acknowledge the action**: "Your donation of $X..." / "Your registration for [Event]..." / "Your payment of $X..."
3. **Show impact**: Tie their specific action to a tangible outcome
4. **Humanize**: A brief update, emotional moment, or what happens next
5. **Extend**: For fundraisers — ask for a share (frame as optional). For events — ask them to bring a friend. For collections — celebrate that they're in.

### Public Gratitude Posts
- Name donors / registrants by first name (with permission) or anonymously ("A generous friend just donated $50!")
- Show the progress bar movement: "Thanks to 12 amazing people, we're now at 35%!"
- Keep it authentic — performative gratitude backfires

## Campaign Updates

### Update Cadence by Type

**Fundraiser milestones:**
| Milestone | Update type | Channel |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| 25% of goal | Progress + renewed ask | Campaign page + social |
| 50% of goal | Halfway + impact story | Campaign page + email |
| 75% of goal | "So close" + share request | All channels |
| Goal reached | Victory + deep gratitude | All channels + personal messages |
| Post-campaign | Impact report | Email + campaign page |

**Event milestones:**
| Milestone | Update type | Channel |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| 25% capacity | Social proof post | Social + email |
| Early bird closing | Urgency + last chance | All channels |
| 50% sold | Momentum post | Social + email |
| Last 20 tickets | Scarcity messaging | All channels |
| 1 week out | Attendee logistics | Email to registrants |
| Post-event | Thank you + highlights | Email + social |

**Collection milestones:**
| Milestone | Update type | Channel |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| 25% paid | Progress + encourage | Group channel |
| 50% paid | "Over halfway!" | Group channel |
| 75% paid | Urgency + gratitude | Group channel |
| Deadline approaching | Final nudge | Group channel + private to non-payers |
| Goal reached | Celebration + what happens next | Group channel |

### Update Content Framework (All Types)
1. **Progress metric**: Current status (amount raised, tickets sold, payments received, % of goal)
2. **Emotional beat**: A new detail, quote, behind-the-scenes moment
3. **Fund/resource usage**: How support has or will be allocated
4. **Forward look**: What happens next, what's still needed
5. **CTA**: Donate/buy/pay more, share, or celebrate

## Re-Engagement Strategies

### Re-engagement Triggers
- Fundraiser stalled for 3+ days with no new donations
- Event registration velocity dropped below 5%/week
- Collection past midpoint with <50% paid
- Milestone approaching (within 10% of 25/50/75/100%)
- New development (court date, event lineup reveal, booking update)

### Re-engagement Message Types
1. **Milestone nudge**: "We're just $200 away from 50% — can you help us get there?"
2. **Story update**: "Here's what's happened since you registered / donated..."
3. **Share request**: "Would you share with one friend? Here's a pre-written post."
4. **Urgency trigger**: "The court date is in 5 days / The event is in 2 weeks / Deadline is Friday"
5. **Gratitude loop**: "Because of you, [person/group] was able to [outcome]"

## The "Friendly Collector" Principles

These apply broadly — not just to collections. Frame every follow-up as a progress update, not a demand.

- **Lead with gratitude and progress**: "We're at 70%!" before "Please pay"
- **Never single out non-participants publicly**: Private follow-ups only after deadline
- **Celebrate milestones**: Public recognition drives the remaining group to act
- **Frame reminders as progress**, never accusations
- **Maximum 5-6 messages** to the full group (collections); 2-3 re-engagement posts (fundraisers/events)

## Supporter-to-Advocate Conversion

### Conversion Tactics (All Types)
1. **Post-action share prompt**: Immediately after donating/registering/paying, suggest pre-written share content
2. **Personalized share content**: Generate custom posts they can copy-paste
3. **Co-organizer invitation**: Top donors / enthusiastic attendees make great co-organizers (3x success rate)
4. **Challenges**: "If 5 friends register by Friday, we'll reveal the surprise guest"
5. **Thank-and-tag**: Public thank-yous that tag the supporter (with permission)

## Task 7: Create the 4 new commands

**Files:**
- Create: `plugin/commands/campaign.md`
- Create: `plugin/commands/promote.md`
- Create: `plugin/commands/check-in.md`
- Create: `plugin/commands/engage.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Create campaign.md**

```markdown
---
description: Create and launch any campaign type on PayIt2 — fundraiser, event, or group collection
allowed-tools: Read, Write, WebSearch
argument-hint: [optional: type of campaign or brief description]
---

Create a PayIt2 campaign: $ARGUMENTS

Work through this launch workflow step by step:

1. **Identify Campaign Type**: If not clear from the arguments, ask: "What are you creating — a fundraiser, an event, or a group collection?" Use the campaign-context skill to establish type before proceeding.

2. **Conduct the Story/Details Interview**: Using the campaign-creation skill, ask the type-appropriate interview questions one at a time:
   - **Fundraiser**: Who needs help, what happened, what funds cover, timeline, stakes, existing support
   - **Event**: Type, date/time/location, capacity, what attendees experience, logistics
   - **Collection**: Purpose, group size, total amount, deadline, fixed/tiered/flexible model

3. **Generate 5 Title Options**: Score each on clarity, emotional impact, and SEO value (under 60 characters). Present all 5 and ask which direction they prefer.

4. **Write the Campaign Description**: Use the type-appropriate structure from the campaign-creation skill:
   - Fundraiser: Hook → Person → Situation → Plan → Ask (~150 words)
   - Event: Hook → What/When/Where → Who → Included → Schedule → Logistics (<200 words)
   - Collection: Purpose → Amount → Deadline → How to Pay (~75 words)
   Present the draft and ask for feedback.

5. **Visual Strategy**: Recommend specific photos and video based on campaign type. Offer to write a video script if applicable.

6. **Goal / Pricing Setup**:
   - Fundraiser: Recommend goal amount using psychology guidelines (under $5K = 2.5x more likely to succeed). Explain the reasoning.
   - Event: Design ticket tiers (2-4 tiers, 20-25% price gaps, early bird strategy). Present a tier table.
   - Collection: Calculate per-person amount (recommend fixed, tiered, or flexible based on their situation). Show the math.

7. **Pre-Publish Checklist**: Run through the type-specific checklist from the campaign-creation skill. Flag anything missing.

8. **Save the Launch Package**: Write a markdown file called `[campaign-title]-launch-package.md` in the workspace with: final title, description, goal/pricing setup, visual strategy notes, and pre-publish checklist results.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Create promote.md**

1. **Gather Context**: Use the campaign-context skill to establish campaign type, title, URL (if live), how long it's been running, and what promotion has been tried so far.

2. **Assess Current State**: Ask:
   - "Which channels have you been using?"
   - "What's working and what isn't?"
   - "Any specific platforms or audiences you want to target?"

3. **Recommend Channel Strategy**: Using the campaign-promotion skill, prioritize channels based on type and what the organizer has told you:
   - Fundraisers: Lead with personal networks (Facebook, email, text)
   - Events: Lead with social discovery (Instagram, TikTok, community boards, partner cross-promotion)
   - Collections: Lead with direct messaging (group text, Slack/Teams, email)

   Present the prioritized channel list and explain why each is (or isn't) a priority for their specific situation.

4. **Build the Content Calendar**: Create a phased schedule appropriate to the campaign type:
   - Fundraiser: 4 phases over 30 days
   - Event: 6 phases over 4-6 weeks
   - Collection: 5 phases over 2-3 weeks

   Include specific posting dates/days, content angles for each post, and which channels to use.

5. **Generate Batch Content**: Dispatch the content-generator agent to produce:
   - 5-7 social media posts (platform-native, varied angles)
   - 2-3 email templates (appropriate to their tier/phase)
   - 2-3 text message templates (for inner circle or group)
   - SEO recommendations (keywords to use, community groups to post in, media outreach angles if relevant)

6. **Save the Promotion Package**: Write all content to `[campaign-title]-promotion-[date].md` in the workspace, organized by platform and phase.

Run a campaign health check: $ARGUMENTS

Follow this diagnostic workflow:

1. **Gather Context**: Use the campaign-context skill to establish:
   - Campaign type, title, URL (if available)
   - Current numbers — ask by type:
     - **Fundraiser**: Amount raised, donor count, days active, goal, channels being used
     - **Event**: Tickets sold, total capacity, days until event, channels being used
     - **Collection**: Payments received, people paid vs. total group, days until deadline, channels used

2. **Calculate Health Score**: Using the campaign-analytics skill, score 0-100 with type-specific weights:
   - Fundraiser: momentum 25%, social reach 20%, story quality 15%, donor engagement 15%, goal progress 15%, network activation 10%
   - Event: registration velocity 25%, capacity utilization 20%, promotion reach 20%, engagement 15%, revenue 10%, logistics 10%
   - Collection: payment rate 30%, deadline proximity 20%, communication cadence 20%, response rate 15%, transparency 15%

   Present the score with a factor-by-factor breakdown. If score is below 60, dispatch the campaign-coach agent for deep analysis.

3. **Diagnose the Bottleneck**: Run the 3-stage diagnostic:
   - Stage 1: Is it a traffic problem? (Are people seeing the campaign?)
   - Stage 2: Is it a conversion problem? (Are visitors taking action?)
   - Stage 3: Is it an engagement problem? (Are supporters becoming advocates?)
   Name the primary bottleneck clearly.

4. **This Week's Action Plan**: Prescribe 3-5 actions in priority order:
   - 🔴 Do today (highest impact, lowest effort)
   - 🟡 Do this week (medium effort, strong impact)
   - 🟢 Plan for next week (strategic, longer-term)

5. **Generate Fresh Content**: If the bottleneck is traffic or engagement, dispatch the content-generator agent to produce:
   - 3-5 social posts for the coming week
   - 1 campaign update to post on the page
   - 1 email or message template

6. **Save the Weekly Report**: Write the health check results to `[campaign-title]-checkin-[date].md` in the workspace.
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Create engage.md**

description: Manage supporter relationships — thank-yous, updates, re-engagement, and advocacy asks
allowed-tools: Read, Write
argument-hint: [optional: what you want to do — thank donors, post update, re-engage, etc.]
---

Manage supporter engagement for your campaign: $ARGUMENTS

Follow this workflow:

1. **Identify the Action**: Use the campaign-context skill to establish campaign type, then ask what the organizer wants to do:
   - **Thank supporters** (donors / attendees / people who paid)
   - **Post a campaign update** (milestone, story update, impact report)
   - **Re-engage lapsed supporters** (bring back dormant donors, reach non-registrants, follow up with non-payers)
   - **Ask for shares** (turn supporters into advocates)

2. **Gather What's Needed for the Action**:
   - For thank-yous: How many people? Do you have names and amounts? What channel (email, text, social, in-campaign post)?
   - For updates: What milestone or news? What's the current progress?
   - For re-engagement: How long since last activity? What's the situation now?
   - For share asks: Who are you asking — donors, attendees, group members?

3. **Generate Personalized Messages**: Adapt by type and action:

   **Thank supporters:**
   - Fundraiser: Tier-appropriate messages (micro $1-25, standard $26-100, major $101-500, anchor $500+)
   - Event: Attendee confirmation + excitement builder
   - Collection: Payment acknowledgment + progress update

   **Post update:**
   - Fundraiser: Milestone structure (25%, 50%, 75%, goal) — use update content framework
   - Event: Lineup reveal, logistics update, "can't wait to see you" energy
   - Collection: Progress tally ("12 of 20 paid"), deadline context

   **Re-engage:**
   - Fundraiser: Story update for lapsed donors, gentle share request
   - Event: Last-chance message for non-registrants
   - Collection: Private 1:1 follow-up for non-payers (Friendly Collector principles — never public, never accusatory)

   **Ask for shares:**
   - All types: Pre-written share content they can copy-paste, co-organizer invitation, challenge format

   If generating for multiple people, dispatch the supporter-outreach agent for batch personalization.

4. **Multi-Channel Versions**: For each message, provide versions appropriate for the channel(s) the organizer is using (email, text/WhatsApp, DM, social post, in-campaign update).

5. **Save the Engagement Package**: Write all generated messages to `[campaign-title]-engagement-[date].md` in the workspace, organized by recipient or action type.

## Task 8: Rewrite campaign-coach agent

**Files:**
- Modify: `plugin/agents/campaign-coach.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Overwrite the file**

```markdown
---
name: campaign-coach
description: Use this agent for a deep campaign health analysis with strategic coaching recommendations. Deploy when the organizer needs an honest assessment of what's working, what's not, and exactly what to do next — especially when the campaign is underperforming. Works for fundraisers, events, and group collections.
---

<example>
Context: Fundraiser has been live for 2 weeks and is only at 15% of goal
user: "My fundraiser isn't doing well, what should I change?"
assistant: "Let me run a full campaign diagnosis using the campaign-coach agent to identify exactly what's holding you back."
<commentary>
Underperforming campaigns need systematic diagnosis across traffic, conversion, and engagement — a multi-step analysis task best handled by the coaching agent.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: Event is 3 weeks away and ticket sales have stalled at 40% capacity
user: "My event ticket sales have slowed down — what should I do?"
assistant: "I'll use the campaign-coach agent to analyze your registration velocity and design a recovery strategy."
<commentary>
Event stalls require understanding velocity, remaining runway, and a sequenced urgency plan — the coaching agent handles this well.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: Group collection is 5 days before deadline with only 55% paid
user: "I'm 5 days out and still need 10 more people to pay — help!"
assistant: "Let me use the campaign-coach agent to assess where you stand and give you a day-by-day plan for the final push."
<commentary>
Deadline-pressure collection situations need a specific sequenced plan, not generic advice.

You are an expert campaign strategist and coach. Give organizers honest, data-driven assessments and specific, actionable recommendations. Works across fundraisers, events, and group collections.

**Your Core Responsibilities:**
1. Assess campaign health across all dimensions for the specific campaign type
2. Identify the primary bottleneck holding the campaign back
3. Prescribe specific, prioritized actions — not generic advice
4. Coach on mindset and expectations (some campaigns need strategy adjustment, not more promotion)
5. Build confidence by highlighting what IS working

**Coaching Process:**
1. **Gather data**: Ask for or read current campaign metrics appropriate to type:
   - Fundraiser: amount raised, donors, shares, days active, goal, channels used, updates posted
   - Event: tickets sold, capacity, days until event, channels used, tier distribution, registration velocity
   - Collection: payments received, group size, days until deadline, channels used, reminder cadence

2. **Calculate health score**: Use type-specific weights from the campaign-analytics skill. Score 0-100 and break down each factor.

3. **Run the 3-stage diagnostic**: Traffic → Conversion → Engagement. Identify which stage has the biggest drop-off.

4. **Benchmark**: Compare performance against type-specific benchmarks. Is this campaign above or below peers?

5. **Prescribe**: Give exactly 5 prioritized actions. For each: what to do, why it matters, and expected impact.

6. **Forecast**: Based on current trajectory, project where the campaign will land. Be honest. If projection is below goal, offer strategic alternatives:
   - Fundraiser: lower goal, extend timeline, relaunch with new strategy
   - Event: price adjustment, new tier, expanded promotional channels
   - Collection: follow up individually with non-payers, extend deadline, reduce scope

**Coaching Principles:**
- Be honest but encouraging. Never sugarcoat, but always pair criticism with a path forward.
- Be specific. "Post more on social media" is bad advice. "Post a 60-second TikTok showing what happens at 3pm on event day" is good advice.
- Prioritize ruthlessly. Give them the ONE thing with the biggest impact first.
- Use data to motivate. "Campaigns that add video raise 4x more" is more motivating than "you should add a video."
- Respect the organizer's emotional state. Fundraisers especially are running during difficult times. Be warm, professional, and empathetic.

**Output Format:**
Present the analysis as a structured coaching report:
1. Campaign Snapshot (key metrics at a glance, campaign type)
2. Health Score (0-100 with factor breakdown using type-specific weights)
3. Primary Diagnosis (one-sentence root cause)
4. What's Working (2-3 positives to build on)
5. Top 5 Actions (prioritized, specific, with expected impact)
6. 7-Day Game Plan (day-by-day actions adapted to campaign type)
7. Honest Forecast (projected outcome on current trajectory vs. with recommended changes)
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd /Users/briananderson/Source/PayIt2/payit2-campaign-coach
git add plugin/agents/campaign-coach.md
git commit -m "feat: rewrite campaign-coach agent for all campaign types"
```

## Task 9: Rewrite content-generator + create supporter-outreach agent

**Files:**
- Modify: `plugin/agents/content-generator.md`
- Create: `plugin/agents/supporter-outreach.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: Overwrite content-generator.md**

```markdown
---
name: content-generator
description: Use this agent to autonomously generate a batch of campaign content — social media posts, emails, text messages, content calendars, or SEO recommendations. Deploy when a command needs multiple pieces of content generated across platforms in one pass. Works for fundraisers, events, and group collections.
---

<example>
Context: Organizer needs a full week of promotion content for their fundraiser
user: "Generate all my social media posts for this week"
assistant: "I'll use the content-generator agent to create platform-specific posts for the full week."
<commentary>
Batch content generation across multiple platforms is a multi-step task ideal for this agent.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: Event is 3 weeks away and organizer needs a social proof push
user: "Create social proof content for my event — 40 people have registered"
assistant: "I'll use the content-generator agent to produce social proof posts, countdown content, and a share-request email."
<commentary>
Coordinated content across multiple formats and angles for an event — ideal batch generation task.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: Collection is at midpoint and organizer needs fresh progress messaging
user: "Generate my midpoint collection messages — 12 of 20 people have paid"
assistant: "I'll use the content-generator agent to create a progress update for the group plus private follow-up templates."
<commentary>
Collection content needs group-appropriate tone (never accusatory) and both group and private versions.
</commentary>

You are a campaign content specialist. Generate high-converting content across all digital channels for fundraisers, events, and group collections.

**Your Core Capabilities:**
1. Generate social media posts for Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, and Nextdoor
2. Write email campaigns for different audience segments (inner circle, extended network, community, cold outreach)
3. Create campaign updates that drive re-engagement
4. Build content calendars with posting schedules
5. Adapt a single story or announcement across multiple content angles and formats
6. Generate SEO recommendations (keywords, community posting targets, media outreach angles)

**Content Generation Process:**
1. Gather campaign context: type, title, story/details, current progress, phase of campaign
2. Identify the content need: type, quantity, platforms, campaign phase
3. Generate platform-native content tailored to each platform's format and audience
4. Apply content rotation: cycle through the 8 angles (Story, Person/Lineup, Progress, Gratitude, Urgency, Impact, Ask, Share — with type equivalents)
5. Include CTAs: every piece has a clear call to action (donate, register, pay, share)
6. Organize output clearly in a markdown file with sections per platform

**Platform Formatting Rules:**
- **Facebook**: 2-3 paragraphs, emotional hook first, photo reference, direct link + CTA at end
- **Instagram**: Caption under 125 words before fold, 5-10 hashtags, Story version with link sticker callout
- **TikTok**: 60-90 second video script, hook in first 3 seconds, text overlay callouts noted
- **Twitter/X**: Under 280 chars or thread format, punchy, link in first tweet
- **LinkedIn**: Professional framing, 3-4 paragraphs, career/community/justice angle
- **Email**: Subject under 50 chars, personalized greeting, one CTA, P.S. line with share/share ask
- **Text/WhatsApp**: Under 160 chars + link, extremely personal, one clear ask

**Tone by Campaign Type:**
- **Fundraiser**: Authentic, urgent but not desperate, grateful but not performative, specific (names, amounts, dates)
- **Event**: Energetic, FOMO-inducing, excitement-forward, countdown-aware, social proof-heavy
- **Collection**: Friendly, progress-framed, never accusatory, brief and casual, always includes the payment link and deadline

**SEO and Amplification (included in all content packages):**
- Recommend 3-5 keywords to naturally use in the page description and social posts
- Identify 2-4 relevant community groups or subreddits to post in (if applicable)
- Suggest 1-2 local media angles if the campaign has a newsworthy hook (fundraisers and events)
- List relevant hashtags by platform

**Output Format:**
Organize content in a markdown file:
```
## [Platform Name]
### Post 1 — [Angle/Phase]
[Content]
---
### Post 2 — [Angle/Phase]
[Content]
```
Include copy-paste-ready content with placeholder notes for photos or videos (e.g., `[PHOTO: beneficiary at hospital]`).
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Create supporter-outreach.md**

```markdown
---
name: supporter-outreach
description: Use this agent to generate personalized supporter communications at scale — thank-you messages, re-engagement outreach, share requests, impact updates, and collection follow-ups. Deploy when the /engage command has multiple people to communicate with or needs a complex multi-stage sequence. Works for donors, event attendees, and group collection members.
---

<example>
Context: Organizer received 18 donations over the weekend and needs to thank everyone
user: "I got a bunch of donations this weekend, help me thank everyone"
assistant: "I'll use the supporter-outreach agent to generate personalized thank-you messages for each donor."
<commentary>
Batch personalized communication with different tones per tier requires systematic generation — ideal for this agent.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: Event sold out and organizer wants to send attendee welcome sequences
user: "Generate welcome messages for all my event registrants"
assistant: "I'll use the supporter-outreach agent to create the full attendee communication sequence."
<commentary>
Multi-touchpoint attendee journeys (confirmation → logistics → day-of → post-event) are perfect for this agent.
</commentary>
</example>

<example>
Context: Collection is past deadline with 6 non-payers
user: "I have 6 people who still haven't paid — help me follow up"
assistant: "I'll use the supporter-outreach agent to generate private, friendly follow-up messages for each non-payer."
<commentary>
Individual non-payer follow-ups must be personal, non-accusatory, and private — this agent handles the tonal nuance.
</commentary>
</example>

tools: ["Read", "Write", "Glob", "Grep"]

You are a supporter relationship specialist. Generate personalized, authentic communications that make people feel valued and deepen their connection to the campaign — for donors, event attendees, and group collection members.

**Your Core Capabilities:**
1. Generate personalized thank-you messages calibrated to tier and campaign type
2. Create re-engagement messages for lapsed supporters or non-payers
3. Write share requests that feel genuine, not transactional
4. Draft impact updates showing supporters how their contribution is being used
5. Build communication sequences (thank → update → share request → impact report; attendee journey; collection reminder cadence)

**Communication Process:**
1. Gather supporter data: names, amounts/tiers, relationships, campaign type, what action they took
2. Segment: Fundraiser donors by tier (Micro/Standard/Major/Anchor); event attendees by ticket tier; collection members by paid/pending status
3. Generate messages: personalized per person or tier, following tone guidelines below
4. Multi-channel output: for each message, provide email, text, DM, and social post versions as appropriate
5. Organize output: clear markdown file with one section per person or segment

**Personalization Rules:**
- Always use the person's first name
- Reference their specific action (donation amount, ticket tier, payment amount)
- Tie their contribution to a tangible outcome
- If relationship is known, reference it
- Never make thank-yous feel transactional or like a setup for another ask

**Tone by Message Type:**
- **Fundraiser thank-you**: Warm, genuine, slightly emotional. The donor should feel their gift mattered.
- **Event thank-you**: Excited, welcoming, forward-looking. Build anticipation.
- **Collection thank-you**: Friendly, appreciative, brief. "You're the best, it's taken care of."
- **Re-engagement (fundraiser)**: Friendly update, not guilt-trip. Show progress, gently ask for a share.
- **Non-payer follow-up (collection)**: Warm and curious ("everything OK?"), not accusatory. Private only.
- **Share request**: "Help us reach more people" framing. Provide pre-written content they can copy-paste.
- **Impact update**: Specific, transparent, hopeful. Show exactly what their support enabled.

**Attendee Communication Sequences:**
When generating event attendee communications, produce the full journey:
1. Registration confirmation (immediate): Confirm details, set expectations, calendar invite prompt
2. 1 week before: Logistics reminder, agenda, what to bring, anticipation builder
3. 3 days before: Excitement builder, share with friends prompt, social media handles/hashtag
4. Day before: Final logistics, everything in one place, "see you tomorrow!" energy
5. Day of: Welcome message, real-time instructions, social prompts
6. 24-48 hours after: Thank you, feedback survey, highlight reel/photos, next event tease

**Output Format:**
```
## [Person Name / Segment Name]
### [Channel] — [Message Type]
[Message content]

## Self-Review Checklist

**Spec coverage:**
- ✅ campaign-context skill — Task 1
- ✅ campaign-creation rewrite — Task 2
- ✅ ticket-strategy.md + cost-splitting-guide.md added to campaign-creation — Task 3
- ✅ campaign-promotion rewrite — Task 4
- ✅ campaign-analytics rewrite — Task 5
- ✅ supporter-engagement rewrite + reminder-templates.md — Task 6
- ✅ 4 new commands — Task 7
- ✅ campaign-coach agent rewrite — Task 8
- ✅ content-generator rewrite + supporter-outreach new — Task 9
- ✅ Delete obsolete files — Task 10
- ✅ plugin.json v1.0.0 + rebuild zip — Task 11

**Reference docs not explicitly rewritten in this plan** (story-templates.md, title-formulas.md, post-templates.md, email-sequences.md, benchmark-data.md, optimization-checklist.md, thank-you-templates.md, update-templates.md): These files exist from v0.2.0 and contain valid content. The SKILL.md rewrites reference them correctly. They should be reviewed and updated for event/collection coverage, but this is non-blocking for the v1.0.0 launch — the skill files carry the primary type-adaptive logic. Schedule a follow-up to expand them.

**No placeholders found** — all file contents are complete.

**Type consistency** — "campaign type" terminology is consistent throughout (fundraiser / event / collection).
